# Piori game

A game where player has to defend themselves from waves of enemies, by building defences like walls and towers. All images are WIP

Enemies become numerous and stronger with each wave, so the player has to continuously improve and construct new defences to defeat them.

Maps are simple with only a couple of types of tiles. Player needs to use the environment to their advantage to delay enemies for as long as possible.
